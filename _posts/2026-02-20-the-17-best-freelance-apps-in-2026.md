# The 17 Best Freelance Apps in 2026

Freelancing offers unparalleled freedom and flexibility, but it comes with a hidden cost: the administrative burden of running your own business. Beyond delivering client work, freelancers juggle invoicing, tax preparation, project management, and client communication—tasks that can quickly consume valuable time and energy.
