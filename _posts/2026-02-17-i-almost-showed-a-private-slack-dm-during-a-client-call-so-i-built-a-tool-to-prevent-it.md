# I Almost Showed a Private Slack DM During a Client Call. So I Built a Tool to Prevent It.

We've all been there: the heart-stopping moment when you realize you're about to share something you shouldn't during a screen share. A stray Slack DM, an email preview, or sensitive client data can all lead to awkward and potentially damaging situations. To solve this problem for myself, I developed a simple Chrome extension called ContextBlur. This article explains the problem, the solution, and how you can use it to avoid similar mishaps.

## The Screen Sharing Minefield

Screen sharing is an essential part of modern remote work. Whether you're presenting to clients, collaborating with colleagues, or giving a demo, the ability to share your screen is crucial. However, it also introduces a significant risk: exposing private or sensitive information.

The potential consequences of accidentally sharing the wrong information can range from embarrassing to seriously damaging. Imagine revealing confidential financial data, a private conversation with a colleague, or a client's sensitive information. The damage to your reputation, your company's reputation, and your client relationships can be significant.

## Introducing ContextBlur: Your Privacy Shield

ContextBlur is a free Chrome extension designed to give you control over what you share during screen sharing. It allows you to selectively blur portions of your screen, hiding sensitive information from your audience. The extension operates entirely within your browser, ensuring that no data leaves your machine. There are no accounts to create, and no data is collected.

## Key Use Cases for ContextBlur

ContextBlur is a versatile tool that can be used in a variety of situations to protect your privacy and prevent accidental disclosures. Here are some common use cases:

1.  Blurring Slack/Teams DMs: Avoid accidentally sharing private conversations during presentations or demos.
2.  Hiding Email Previews: Prevent email notifications from popping up and revealing sensitive information.
3.  Covering Sensitive Client Data: Protect client confidentiality during live demos or presentations.
4.  Blocking Salary/Finance Info: Hide sensitive financial data when sharing dashboards or spreadsheets.
5.  Protecting Personal Information: Blur out personal details like addresses or phone numbers when sharing documents.

## How to Use ContextBlur

ContextBlur is designed to be simple and intuitive to use. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1.  Install the Extension: Download ContextBlur from the Chrome Web Store.
2.  Activate the Extension: Click the ContextBlur icon in your Chrome toolbar to activate the extension.
3.  Select the Area to Blur: Use your mouse to drag a rectangle around the area you want to blur.
4.  Blurring is Active: The selected area will now be blurred, obscuring the content beneath.
5.  Toggle On/Off: Click the ContextBlur icon again to disable blurring and reveal the content.

## Benefits of Using ContextBlur

## Why a Browser-Based Solution?

There are several reasons why I chose to develop ContextBlur as a browser extension:

## Preventing Future Screen Sharing Mishaps

While ContextBlur is a valuable tool, it's important to adopt other best practices to prevent screen sharing mishaps:

1.  Close Unnecessary Tabs: Before sharing your screen, close any tabs that contain sensitive or irrelevant information.
2.  Disable Notifications: Turn off notifications from email, messaging apps, and other programs to avoid unexpected pop-ups.
3.  Review Your Screen: Take a moment to review your screen before sharing to ensure that everything is in order.
4.  Practice Makes Perfect: Practice screen sharing with a colleague to identify any potential issues.
5.  Be Mindful: Always be aware of what you're sharing and who you're sharing it with.
